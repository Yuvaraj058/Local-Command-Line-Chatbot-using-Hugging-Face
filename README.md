# ðŸ’¬ Smart Terminal Chatbot (with Memory)

This project implements a simple yet smart **terminal-based chatbot** using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.  
It can:
- Respond to user queries instantly through the terminal.
- Maintain short-term memory (context of recent messages).
- Handle factual Q&A and small talk (e.g., greetings, farewells).
- Exit gracefully on command `/exit`.
